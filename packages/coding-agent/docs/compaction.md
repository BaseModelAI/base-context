# Compaction & Branch Summarization

LLMs have limited context windows. When conversations grow too long, Base Context uses compaction to summarize older content while preserving recent work. This page covers both auto-compaction and branch summarization.

**Source files:**
- [`compaction.ts`](../src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) - Auto-compaction logic
- [`branch-summarization.ts`](../src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts) - Branch summarization
- [`utils.ts`](../src/core/compaction/utils.ts) - Shared utilities (file tracking, serialization)
- [`session-manager.ts`](../src/core/session-manager.ts) - Entry types (`CompactionEntry`, `BranchSummaryEntry`)
- [`extensions/types.ts`](../src/core/extensions/types.ts) - Extension event types

The linked source files define the current Base Context API. Package availability and source installation are described in the [package README](../README.md).

## Overview

Base Context has two summarization mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Compaction | Context exceeds threshold, or `/compact` | Summarize old messages to free up context |
| Branch summarization | `/tree` navigation | Preserve context when switching branches |

Both use the same structured summary format and track file operations cumulatively.

The diagrams below describe summary-and-tail mechanics, not an exact native provider
request. Native context also uses captured source, accepted epochs, required replay
groups and bounded recovery. A missing source or boundary can refuse rather than
silently produce an incomplete context.

Compaction does not establish whether a Python kernel, its variables or background
jobs are still available. Use current runtime reports; do not infer either survival
or loss from a summary alone.

## Compaction

### When It Triggers

Auto-compaction triggers when:

```
contextTokens > contextWindow - reserveTokens
```

By default, `reserveTokens` is 16384 tokens (configurable in `~/.base-context/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.base-context/settings.json`). This leaves room for the LLM's response.

You can also trigger manually with `/compact [instructions]`, where optional instructions focus the summary — for example `/compact focus on the auth refactor, remember the exact migration command`. The instructions are passed to the summarization prompt with high priority, persisted on the `CompactionEntry`, and shown on the `[compaction]` message in the TUI.

### How It Works

1. **Find cut point**: Walk backwards from newest message, accumulating token estimates until `keepRecentTokens` (default 20k, configurable in `~/.base-context/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.base-context/settings.json`) is reached
2. **Extract messages**: Collect messages from the previous kept boundary (or session start) up to the cut point
3. **Generate summary**: Call LLM to summarize with structured format, passing the previous summary as iterative context when present
4. **Append entry**: Save `CompactionEntry` with summary and `firstKeptEntryId`
5. **Reload**: Session reloads, using summary + messages from `firstKeptEntryId` onwards

```
Before compaction:

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┘
                └────────┬───────┘ └──────────────┬──────────────┘
               messagesToSummarize            kept messages
                                   ↑
                          firstKeptEntryId (entry 4)

After compaction (new entry appended):

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9     10
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│ cmp │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
               └──────────┬──────┘ └──────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                 not sent to LLM                    sent to LLM
                                                         ↑
                                              starts from firstKeptEntryId

What the LLM sees:

  ┌────────┬─────────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
  │ system │ summary │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
  └────────┴─────────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
       ↑         ↑      └─────────────────┬────────────────┘
    prompt   from cmp          messages from firstKeptEntryId
```

On repeated compactions, the resident `prepareCompaction` helper starts at the
previous `firstKeptEntryId` when that entry is present. Its legacy fallback starts
after the previous compaction entry. This helper fallback is not a promise that
native captured-history reads accept an unavailable retained boundary.

`tokensBefore` records a prior-context estimate, or `null` when the original
context is not measurable. It is not an exact serialized-provider token count or
a guarantee that the reconstructed context matches a previous request.

### Split Turns

A "turn" starts with a user message and includes all assistant responses and tool calls until the next user message. Normally, compaction cuts at turn boundaries.

When a single turn exceeds `keepRecentTokens`, the cut point lands mid-turn at an assistant message. This is a "split turn":

```
Split turn (one huge turn exceeds budget):

  entry:  0     1     2      3     4      5      6     7      8
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
                ↑                                     ↑
         turnStartIndex = 1                  firstKeptEntryId = 7
                │                                     │
                └──── turnPrefixMessages (1-6) ───────┘
                                                      └── kept (7-8)

  isSplitTurn = true
  messagesToSummarize = []  (no complete turns before)
  turnPrefixMessages = [usr, ass, tool, ass, tool, tool]
```

For split turns, Base Context generates two summaries and merges them:
1. **History summary**: Previous context (if any)
2. **Turn prefix summary**: The early part of the split turn

### Cut Point Rules

Valid cut points are:
- User messages
- Assistant messages
- BashExecution messages
- Custom messages (custom_message, branch_summary)

Never cut at tool results (they must stay with their tool call).

### CompactionEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](../src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface CompactionEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "compaction";
  id: string;
  parentId: string | null;
  timestamp: string;
  summary: string;
  firstKeptEntryId: string;
  tokensBefore: number | null;
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
  customInstructions?: string;  // user instructions from /compact <instructions>
}

// Default compaction uses this for details (from compaction.ts):
interface CompactionDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
}
```

Extensions can store any JSON-serializable data in `details`. The default compaction tracks file operations, but custom extension implementations can use their own structure.

See [`prepareCompaction()` and `compact()`](../src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) for the implementation.

### Stop and Resume Ownership

At a compatible turn boundary, native checkpoint control uses the loop's finalized
tool-batch decision and existing accepted session inputs. The last message's role
is not a resume instruction. If every finalized tool result requests termination,
that batch does not request an automatic follow-up. Separately accepted goal,
autonomous or user input can still own more work.

Automatic threshold admission respects the existing context-optimization gate.
An explicit request accepted while permitted retains its existing ownership; this
does not grant new compaction permission while optimization is off.

A `checkpoint_then_continue` intent does not mean that a checkpoint has committed.
The existing compaction owner records the accepted checkpoint and completes its
setup/release before normal success resumption. Queued inputs go first. An input
invocation that consumes the interrupted boundary must not leave an extra resume
behind. Ordinary completed-turn compaction with no further work finishes normally.

The existing policy can resume interrupted work after a skipped compaction or an
ordinary failure. No ACK is not proof that no write occurred. Abort does not resume.
A known checkpoint ACK followed by setup or release failure remains a committed
checkpoint plus a later failure, not a reason to repeat the summary or auto-resume.
The transient resume intent does not add crash recovery or change accepted queued
input and epoch formats.

## Branch Summarization

### When It Triggers

When you use `/tree` to navigate to a different branch, Base Context offers to summarize the work you're leaving. This injects context from the left branch into the new branch.

### How It Works

1. **Find common ancestor**: Deepest node shared by old and new positions
2. **Collect entries**: Walk from old leaf back to common ancestor
3. **Prepare with budget**: Include messages up to token budget (newest first)
4. **Generate summary**: Call LLM with structured format
5. **Append entry**: Save `BranchSummaryEntry` at navigation point

```
Tree before navigation:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D (old leaf, being abandoned)
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (target)

Common ancestor: A
Entries to summarize: B, C, D

After navigation with summary:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D ─ [summary of B,C,D]
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (new leaf)
```

### Cumulative File Tracking

Both compaction and branch summarization track files cumulatively. When generating a summary, Base Context extracts file operations from:
- Tool calls in the messages being summarized
- Previous compaction or branch summary `details` (if any)

This means file tracking accumulates across multiple compactions or nested branch summaries, preserving the full history of read and modified files.

### BranchSummaryEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](../src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface BranchSummaryEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "branch_summary";
  id: string;
  parentId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  summary: string;
  fromId: string;      // Entry we navigated from
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
}

// Default branch summarization uses this for details (from branch-summarization.ts):
interface BranchSummaryDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
}
```

Same as compaction, extensions can store custom data in `details`.

See [`collectEntriesForBranchSummary()`, `prepareBranchEntries()`, and `generateBranchSummary()`](../src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts) for the implementation.

## Summary Format

Both compaction and branch summarization use the same structured format:

```markdown
## Goal
[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Requirements mentioned by user]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [What should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Data needed to continue]

<read-files>
path/to/file1.ts
path/to/file2.ts
</read-files>

<modified-files>
path/to/changed.ts
</modified-files>
```

### Message Serialization

Before summarization, messages are serialized to text via [`serializeConversation()`](../src/core/compaction/utils.ts):

```
[User]: What they said
[Assistant thinking]: Internal reasoning
[Assistant]: Response text
[Assistant tool calls]: ipython(code="open('foo.ts').read()"); edit(path="bar.ts", ...)
[Tool result]: Output from tool
```

This prevents the model from treating it as a conversation to continue.

Tool results are truncated to 2000 characters during serialization. Content beyond that limit is replaced with a marker indicating how many characters were truncated. This keeps summarization requests within reasonable token budgets, since tool results, especially from `ipython` and optional `bash`, are typically the largest contributors to context size.

## Custom Summarization via Extensions

Extensions can intercept and customize both compaction and branch summarization. See [`extensions/types.ts`](../src/core/extensions/types.ts) for event type definitions.

### session_before_compact

Fired before auto-compaction or `/compact`. Can cancel or provide custom summary. See `SessionBeforeCompactEvent` and `CompactionPreparation` in the types file.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, branchEntries, customInstructions, signal } = event;

  // preparation.messagesToSummarize - messages to summarize
  // preparation.turnPrefixMessages - split turn prefix (if isSplitTurn)
  // preparation.previousSummary - previous compaction summary
  // preparation.fileOps - extracted file operations
  // preparation.tokensBefore - context tokens before compaction
  // preparation.firstKeptEntryId - where kept messages start
  // preparation.settings - compaction settings

  // branchEntries - all entries on current branch (for custom state)
  // signal - AbortSignal (pass to LLM calls)

  // Cancel:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Custom summary:
  return {
    compaction: {
      summary: "Your summary...",
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
      details: { /* custom data */ },
    }
  };
});
```

#### Converting Messages to Text

To generate a summary with your own model, convert messages to text using `serializeConversation`:

```typescript
import { convertToLlm, serializeConversation } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation } = event;
  
  // Convert AgentMessage[] to Message[], then serialize to text
  const conversationText = serializeConversation(
    convertToLlm(preparation.messagesToSummarize)
  );
  // Returns:
  // [User]: message text
  // [Assistant thinking]: thinking content
  // [Assistant]: response text
  // [Assistant tool calls]: ipython(code="open('...').read()"); bash(command="...")
  // [Tool result]: output text

  // Now send to your model for summarization
  const summary = await myModel.summarize(conversationText);
  
  return {
    compaction: {
      summary,
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
    }
  };
});
```

See [custom-compaction.ts](../examples/extensions/custom-compaction.ts) for a complete example using a different model.

### session_before_tree

Fired before `/tree` navigation. Always fires regardless of whether user chose to summarize. Can cancel navigation or provide custom summary.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_tree", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, signal } = event;

  // preparation.targetId - where we're navigating to
  // preparation.oldLeafId - current position (being abandoned)
  // preparation.commonAncestorId - shared ancestor
  // preparation.entriesToSummarize - entries that would be summarized
  // preparation.userWantsSummary - whether user chose to summarize

  // Cancel navigation entirely:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Provide custom summary (only used if userWantsSummary is true):
  if (preparation.userWantsSummary) {
    return {
      summary: {
        summary: "Your summary...",
        details: { /* custom data */ },
      }
    };
  }
});
```

See `SessionBeforeTreeEvent` and `TreePreparation` in the types file.

## Settings

Configure compaction in `~/.base-context/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.base-context/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reserveTokens": 16384,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable auto-compaction |
| `reserveTokens` | `16384` | Headroom used by the compaction threshold |
| `keepRecentTokens` | `20000` | Estimated recent-token target for the retained tail |

Disable automatic compaction with `"compaction": { "enabled": false }`. Manual
`/compact` remains available while `context.mode` is `"on"`. Setting `context.mode`
to `"off"` disables context optimization, including manual compaction; logging,
recovery, limits and other non-optimization ownership remain active.

These threshold and tail settings are not a complete provider-request token limit
or a spending quota.
